# Calculator
This Python script implements a simple calculator application. It allows users to perform arithmetic operations.
This Python function, switch(), implements a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-input values (a and b). Here's a breakdown of how it works:

It first prompts the user to enter two floating-point numbers, a and b.
It then presents a menu of arithmetic operations for the user to choose from: addition (1), subtraction (2), multiplication (3), and division (4).
Based on the user's choice, it performs the selected arithmetic operation on a and b and prints the result.
